# Welcome!

## About Me
Hi there! I'm Abhinav, also known as Abhi. I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. I've done a ton of things with what I've learned, but right now, I'm focusing on Computer Systems and looking to learn more in that domain.

This GitHub repository attempts to showcase my ability, the things that interest me, and what I've learnt, and also acts as a base of operations as I keep developing.

## Education
- **Undergraduate:** Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, Georgia Institute of Technology - Computer Media & Artificial Intelligence
- **Graduate:** Master of Science in Computer Science, Georgia Institute of Technology - Computing Systems + Graduate Teaching
